        * From the bottom up, look at each stage.  Produce a new profile
          that asks for the deltaV the stages provide, up to the total
          deltaV, and the max acceleration of any burn affected by this
          burn.  In other words, if we have wasted stages at the end of our
          trip, we will eliminate them.

          the end is pushed back, and hopefully we can squeeze some of it all
